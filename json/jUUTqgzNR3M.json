  "description": "Visual diffs are a great way to check for regressions on web sites which may be missed by unit tests. In this talk you'll learn how to run end-to-end tests on your client and server web libraries using a tool called dpxdt. I'll also show how you can combine it with web-based diff tools like \"\"git webdiff\"\" to quickly and confidently iterate on web tools.\n\n",
