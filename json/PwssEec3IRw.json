  "description": "---Partial tutorial, only the beginning of the tutorial was recorded, sorry for the inconvenience---\n\n\"Speaker: Kenny Yarboro\n\nUsing a combination of Django and Django REST Framework, we will build a Restaurant Menu that can be managed via a REST API. Starting from the install of the Django REST Framework, we will build our way to a functional API that meets the needs of developers and end-users. You will walk away with an understanding of the basic concepts of REST APIs and a working sample project.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015 and https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides\"",
