  "description": "Statistical inference is a fundamental tool in science and engineering, but it is often poorly understood. \u00a0This tutorial uses computational methods, including Monte Carlo simulation and resampling, to explore estimation, hypothesis testing and statistical modeling. \u00a0Attendees will develop understanding of statistical concepts and learn to use real data to answer relevant questions.\n\n\n",
