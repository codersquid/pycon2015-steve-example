  "description": "This is a tutorial that goes beyond most tutorials; it's meant for developers who already know a bit about Django and want to really understand the inner guts of the framework. This tutorial will *not* involve writing code or apps; rather, it'll be a deep tour of the workings and APIs of Django itself, across all the bundled components and at all levels of the stack.\n\n",
