  "description": "We've ported Python to run directly on hardware, without an OS, as a testing and exploration environment for firmware, ACPI, and UEFI. This talk will explore porting Python to a new platform, embedding Python, recreating enough of libc and POSIX to run Python without an OS, and binding to platform-specific services. Includes live demo of bare-metal Python, directly driving hardware.\n\n",
