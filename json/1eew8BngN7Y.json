  "description": "This talk introduces the asyncio module. I'll cover what it's for, how it works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked application (a distributed hash table).\nWe'll explore the event loop, co-routines, futures and networking with examples from my code.\nThis won't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough of asyncio to continue with their own studies.\n\n",
